# Blindman-Assitant

The main goal of this project was to help blind persons to detect nearby obstacles. The prototype contains 3 sonar sensors placed at the front of the blind person which will measure distance from the blind person to any nearby obstacles (eg. walls). If there is any obstacles in a certain distance the controller will buzz off the buzzer to alert the blind person.

Expertise: 1 Arduino Uno, 3 sonar sensors, 3 relays, 3 LEDs(testing purpose), 3 buzzers, 1 breadboard, some wires.
